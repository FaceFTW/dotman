# Dotman

`dotman` is a diverging fork of [`SuperCuber/dotter`](https://github.com/SuperCuber/dotter), which now seems to be unmaintained. This fork has some key differences from `dotter` to make it much "lighter" but still retain compatibility with the original tool.

___This divergence is a work in progress, with breaking changes detailed as they are made.___
